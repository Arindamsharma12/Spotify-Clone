ðŸŽ¶ Excited to share my latest project â€“ a Spotify Clone! ðŸŽ¶

Iâ€™ve developed a fully functional music player that replicates the original Spotify experience using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was a fun challenge, and I'm really happy with how it turned out!

Here are some key features:

ðŸŽ§ Play, Pause, and Skip Tracks
ðŸ”„ Previous and Next Track Navigation
ðŸ“€ Album Selection with individual JSON files for each album, containing title and description info
ðŸ”Š Volume Control
To ensure an authentic feel, I used SVG files for high-quality visuals and created a fully responsive design so the site works seamlessly across all devices, including mobile, with a sleek hamburger menu for easy navigation. ðŸ“±

This project has been an incredible journey, allowing me to delve deeper into front-end web development, data handling with JSON, and responsive design techniques.

Feel free to check it out and let me know what you think!
